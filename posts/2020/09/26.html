<p class="subtitle">So, I got my brother to download NMS. I started off with the best intentions to help him get going‚Ä¶ Then things took a very dangerous turn.</p>

<p>After loading him up with some basic resources to save him from farming, we bounced around and I followed him along on his first few tutorial missions.</p>
<p>He fixed his starship, we took off, and after getting the signal needed to land on another planet and build something.</p>
<p>While he‚Äôs doing so a sentinal rolls in‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I freeze.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs off trying to navigate menus somewhere‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Sentinal activates. Scatter blast a few pumps‚Ä¶ Moving on.</p>
<p>Reinforcements incoming‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Still navigating menus in the distance‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Me dancing around a sentinal dog reloading my scatter blaster‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow do I make dihydrogen jelly?‚Äù</p>
<p>BLASTING AWAY ‚ÄúOPEN YOUR EXOSUIT MENU AND PRESS CRAFT ON AN OPEN SLOT‚Äù BLAST BLAST, BOOT BOOST TURN AND BLAST.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBro, we gotta leave‚Ä¶ Now‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>‚ÄúSentinel walker incoming‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBro just get in your ship we gotta leave, they won‚Äôt stop‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell you gotta figure that KZZZTT out cause I don‚Äôt even know why menu I‚Äôm in‚Äù</p>
<p>WALKER BEAM COMES BLASTING THROUGH MY FACE üòê</p>
<p>‚ÄúOKAY, UMM‚Ä¶ WELL TAKE COVER OR SOMETHING OR GET I YOUR SHIP CAUSE THIS THING IS GOING TO LITERALLY KILL YOU. YOU‚ÄôRE JUST A FRAGILE LITTLE BABY INTERLOPER.‚Äù</p>
<p>I proceed to dance around this walker taking off pieces of armor one by one. Just thanking myself in the back of my head for buying that life support module before grouping up‚Ä¶ Eventually it goes Kzzt and hits the floor. Walker brain in suit inventory.</p>
<p>Okay let‚Äôs go.</p>
<p>Zoot into space and of course, a subspace scan and the sentinal FLEET converges on us. 5 off the top and then 6 more on a second wave.</p>
<p>(Him without knowing how to repair his weapons üò¶ watching me zip around blasting sentinals)</p>
<p>They backed off and we shot back down to the surface‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Coincidentally IN THE SAME EXACT SPOT AND GUESS WHO WAS WAITING FOR US.</p>
<p>Another walker.</p>
<p>His portable refiner is on the ground and needs to pick it up so I land and get to blasting this walker‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>More blasting. Get the plating off and going at the brain‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And then‚Ä¶</p>
<p>ZAP ZAP ZAP OUT OF NOWHWHERE and my bro comes flying in taking down the walker WITH HIS STARSHIP. He fixed it and saved the freaking day.</p>
<p>I blast open the capsule and transfer the walker brain to his inventory.</p>
<p>Here‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll need this later.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm so proud. üò≠</p>
